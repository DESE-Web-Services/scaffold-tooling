# Ahoy imports for GovCMS

Ahoy commands are grouped logically based on the type of task being done.

There are two alternative locations for ahoy commands.

.ahoy.yml in the scaffold should not be edited and is reserved for:
  * including other ahoy command files
  * high-level tooling (eg ahoy drush)

./local/ahoy-loc.yml is for customers to set up custom commands.
